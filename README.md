Developer Notes:

00AutoInstallVOInstall.ps1 - Power Shell Script to Easily Call Weidu.exe, not strictly required but makes things easier.

00CREATEVOICEREF.BAT - Drag and drop an audio file to quickly make a new charecter ref (seed). Make sure to transcribe the matching txt file with the words that are actually in the audio.

build_autovo.py - The main brains. Does all the heavy lifting. This must be executed from within WSL's voxcpm venv. 

Weidu.exe / conf - Required for most parts of interacting with Infinity Engine pieces. Included for convenience here, but you can also source from https://weidu.org/ if you don't trust any random exe on the internet (good on you!)
